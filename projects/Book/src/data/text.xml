<steps>
	<step canTurn="false">
		Start with a new component, extending UIComponent.
	</step>
	<step canTurn="false">
		Draw the open pages on either side.
	</step>
	<step canTurn="false">
		draw gradients on the two open pages to give them a sense of curvature.
	</step>
	<step canTurn="false">
		adjust their alpha so they enhance the underlying page content.
	</step>
	<step canTurn="false">
		Draw the mouse sensitive region in an overlay sprite. This has two effects -- one, it prevents the 
		content in this region from getting mouse events (which is what we want) -- and two, it makes it easy
		to do hit detection -- if we get a mouseDown event on the overlay sprite, we know we should start a turn.
	</step>
	<step canTurn="false">
		hide the overlay sprite. If we set it to visible=false, we wouldn't get any mouse events on it.
		Instead, we draw the mouse sensitive region with an alpha of zero. That makes it invisible to the 
		user, but visible to the mouse.
	</step>
	<step>
		When the user clicks on the overlay to turn forward:
		- set the displayed right page to show the page they're turning to.
		- record where on the edge of the page they clicked down.
		- track the mouse position.  Remember the line from the mouse down location to the current mouse position.
		
		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>
	
	<step>
		As the mouse moves, we must identify the 'fold' of the page.
		- draw the line between the mouse point and the original grab point,
		- find its midpoint
		- find the perpendicular line through that midpoint.
		- that's the page fold.
		
		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>

	<step>
		Now we must identify the shape of the turning page. Time to pull out our geometry again.
		- identify where the fold intersects the top and bottom of the book.
		- identify where the fold intersects the side of the book
		- if it intersects the top side before the side, then:
  			- take the line from the top corner to where the top intersects the fold.
			- reflect the line over the fold. That is the top edge of the turned page.
		- otherwise, there is no top edge to the fold, only a point.
		- repeat with the bottom edge/corner to identify the bottom edge of the turned page.
		- the line between the top/bottom edges of the turned page represents the leading edge of the turned page.
		- this is the folded page polygon.

		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>
	<step>
		Now we'll fill in the turning page.  
		-First, identify what child represents the back of the turning page.
		- create a bitmap the size of the page.
		- copy the back page child into the bitmap.
		- construct a matrix that places that bitmap aligned with the top or bottom corners
		  of the turned page.

		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>		
	<step>
		Now we want to clip the turning page to the turning polygon we calculated earlier.
		- instead of placing the bitmap on screen, we use it as a bitmap fill and draw a polygon.
		- apply the same matrix transform to the fill to get the bitmap in the right place.
		- draw the revealed page polygon we computed earlier

		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>
	<step>
		Now we want to draw the top of the turning page.
		- identify what child represents the front of the turning page.
		- as before, create a bitmap the size of the page and copy the child into it.
		- construct a polygon consisting of the top and bottom of the book's spine and the fold intersection points. 
		- use our top page bitmap to fill in the top page polygon.

		This one is hard to spot. Notice that when you turn the page, the top of the turning page doesn't dissapear, and the right hand page doesn't 
		show through. go back and look at the previous step if can't see the difference.

		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>
	<step>
		Draw a gradient on the bottom of the turned page to create a curved appearance.
		
		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>
	<step>
		Draw that gradient with an alpha to blend it in with the content.
		
		Turn the page, either with the buttons to the left, or click and 
		drag on the corner of the book to see the effect.
	</step>
