      <!-- Apollo Application Descriptor File

      The Apollo application descriptor file specifies parameters
      for identifying, installing, and launching Apollo applications.

      The root element of the descriptor file is "application" and has the following attributes:

          appID — A string identifying this application. Every Apollo application must
                 have a unique appID. The recommended form of an appID is a dot-delimited,
                 reverse-DNS-style string, such as: "com.adobe.apollo.ApplicationName"
                 The appID string must be between 17-255 characters long
                 and may include the following characters:

                      0-9 
                      a-z 
                      A-Z 
                      . (dot)
                      - (hyphen)

          version - An application-defined version designator of the standard form: 
                   "MajorVersion.MinorVersion", where MajorVersion and MinorVersion
                   are numbers. Additional point designators are allowed after the minor
                   version, and may include letters. Examples: "1.0", ".4", "0.5", "4.9", "1.3.4a"

          xmlns — The Apollo namespace ("http://ns.adobe.com/apollo/application/1.0.M3").

      <!--
      The rootContent element identifies the main content file of the application,
      which must be a SWF or HTML file. rootContent has the following attributes:

      systemChrome — "standard" or "none". If "standard", the application window is opened  
                    with operating system-specific window elements such as a title bar, 
                    minimize, and close buttons. If "none", the application must provide
                    its own window controls. (Note, that the ApolloApplication class supplies
                    a set of window controls, which are only shown when systemChrome="none".)

      transparent — "true" or "false". If "true", the application has support for full 
                   transparency. (For the Apollo M3 release, setting transparent="true" has no 
                   effect if systemChrome="standard").

      visible — "true" or "false". If "false", the main window will not be displayed 
               until the application changes the visible property.

      The SWF reference required within this tag will be set automatically by Flex Builder
      when you launch or export this application. There is no need to set it here.

      <!--
      Specifies one or more graphics files to be used as application icons. The path specified
      is relative to the application root directory. For M3, PNG, GIF, and JPEG formats 
      are supported. If you do not specify an icon, the default Apollo icon is used. To avoid 
      scaling, you can specify all of the following icon sizes:

      <icon>
          <image16x16>...</image16x16>
          <image32x32>...</image32x32>
          <image48x48>...</image48x48>
          <image128x128>...</image128x128> 
      </icon>

      If an image is provided, it must be the size specified or application installation will fail. 
      If all sizes are not provided, the closest size will be scaled to fit for a given use of the 
      icon by the operating system.
      (Optional)
