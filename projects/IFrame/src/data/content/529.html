                  <P>Dear Account Owner,</P>
                  <P>Tax season is filled with deadlines, computations, and 
                  paperwork. But for 529 account owners like you, it's also 
                  filled with opportunities.</P>
                  <P>One of the most obvious opportunities — and easiest to take 
                  advantage of — is maximizing the tax benefits your Golden 
                  State ScholarShare® College Savings Trust (ScholarShare) 529 
                  account offers. Opening a ScholarShare 529 account gives you a 
                  chance to enjoy freedom from California state and federal 
                  income taxes on any earnings for your college savings, when 
                  withdrawn for qualified education expenses. (The law allowing 
                  federal tax-free qualified withdrawals is set to expire on 
                  December 31, 2010. Congress may or may not extend the law 
                  beyond that date.)</P>
                  <P>One of the best ways to do it is through the available <A 
                  href="http://messaging.tiaa-cref.org/W3RH03043D1C5B593987532BEF6AE0" 
                  target=new>Automatic Contribution Plan</A>. Tax season is a 
                  great time to set it up, since it lets you relax for the rest 
                  of the year knowing that you're taking advantage of your 529 
                  account tax benefits. And since you'll be saving for college 
                  automatically, you might not even notice your regular 
                  investments.</P>
                  <P>Another way to maximize your tax benefits is by investing 
                  any tax refund you might be getting this year into your 529 
                  account. You'll feel great knowing that you're doing all you 
                  can for your child — while taking better advantage of the 
                  investment opportunities your 529 account offers.</P>
                  <P>The bottom line is that regular investments could make a 
                  difference in the long run. And making an investment is as 
                  easy as clicking the button. Why not consider <A

                  mind?</P>
                  <P>You deserve a lot of credit for opening a ScholarShare 
                  account in the first place. <STRONG>We just wanted to remind 
                  you of a few ways you could be taking even better advantage of 
                  the tax-advantaged investment opportunities ScholarShare 
                  offers.</STRONG></P><IMG height=72 alt=""
